            <p>Whole Body Vibration  is for patients who are stiff, lack core strength, and want to get their bodies stimulated, start exercising, and get moving. WBV increases muscle tone, blood flow, lymphatic drainage, and endorphins, while decreasing cortisol- a hormone involved with stress. By increasing circulation and oxygenation throughout the entire body, WBV wakens cells, tissues, and muscles that havenâ€™t been active in years.</p>
