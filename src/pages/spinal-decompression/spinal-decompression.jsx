            <h2>Spinal Decompression</h2>
            <p>Thinking about spinal Decompression? You don't have to live in debilitating pain. Whether you have lower back pain, a pinched nerve, sciatica, radiating pain into the arms or legs, neck pain, or a variety of symptoms related to damaged or degenerative discs, spinal stenosis and post-operative complications, as well as syndromes of the lumbar and cervical spine. Spinal Decompression may be for you.</p>
            <p>This gentle, non-surgical procedure can provide lower back and neck pain relief, sciatica pain relief, and is a state-of-the-art procedure for, bulging, herniated or degenerative disc disease in the neck and lumbar regions.</p>
            <p>The gentle distractive forces of the Spinal Decompression create a decompression of the spine with unloading due to distraction and proper positioning, to improve blood flow and nutrient exchange to the injured area. You'll experience several cycles of stretch and relaxation, which graduates to a peak over a period of several minutes.</p>
            <h3>How long does the treatment take</h3>
            <p>Therapy sessions typically last less than 20 minutes, 3 times a week for 1 month, transitioning from passive to active treatments as you respond, with most patients feeling pain relief with as few as 6-10 treatments. Most patients are released from treatment after 8 weeks.</p>
            <p>A complete program targeting the function of the stabilization ligaments, tendons and muscles is a vital part of Spinal Decompression. Exercise and adjunctive therapies such as heat, muscle stimulation, ultrasound, and cold therapy can assist in rehabilitation of these structures. Our goal is to not only help heal the disc, but to also enhance muscular control and support of the back and neck.</p>
            <p>Regular home exercise and periodic visits to our office will help in maintaining your spinal health and reduce the probability of reoccurrence.</p>
