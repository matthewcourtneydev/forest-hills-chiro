      <h2>Cold Laser Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        Are you looking for cold laser therapy in Forest Hills? In recent years,
        many medical and alternative health clinics have begun including light
        therapies into their traditional treatment methods. One of the most
        popular light therapies being used is cold laser therapy or low level
        laser therapy. When tissues are damaged, cells begin to die and scar
        tissue formation often begins. Both of these consequences can slow or
        even limit the healing process. Modern day cold laser units have been
        specifically engineered to produce the essential wavelengths of light
        necessary stimulate the damage cells, break up the formed scar tissue,
        and stimulate the healing process.

        Cold laser units come in various sizes and shapes. Often the units used
        are handheld and similar to the size of an average flashlight. The
        treatment time required is usually dependent on two factors, the
        condition being treated and the size of the area affected. A major
        advantage of cold laser therapy units is the ability to penetrate deep
        into tissues and joints while retaining the capability to also treat
        conditions closer to the skin surface. People utilizing cold laser
        therapy as a non-invasive form of treatment report feeling little or no
        sensation during the treatment process. Regardless of how deep the light
        waves penetrate, the energy is eventually absorbed by the damaged cell
        providing it with the boost to begin working. Plants using the suns
        light to stimulate growth and healing is a good analogy to demonstrate
        the effects of cold laser therapy. As these cells are repaired, the body
        is able to decrease the sensation of pain, reduce swelling, and
        accelerate the time required to heal.
